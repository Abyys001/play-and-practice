"""
Explore the Decimal class, which has an alternative
floating-point representation thats as accurate as any decimal number can be.
Write a function that takes two strings from the user, turns them into decimal
instances, and then prints the floating-point sum of the users two inputs. In
other words, make it possible for the user to enter 0.1 and 0.2, and for us to get
0.3 back.
