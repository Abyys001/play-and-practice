"""
1. Write a function (guessing_game) that takes no arguments. 
2. When run, the function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
3. Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.
4. Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of the following:
    - too low 
    - too high
    - just right!
5. If the user guesses correctly, the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.
6. The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.

EXTRA:
7. Modify this program, such that it gives the user only three chances to guess the
correct number. If they try three times without success, the program tells them
that they didnâ€™t guess in time and then exits.
